# shtytlkr
A Telegram bot that uses DECtalk to say whatever you tell it.
Feel free to give it a try [https://t.me/shtytlkr_bot](https://t.me/shtytlkr_bot)

This has almost all the features of the traditional DECtalk executable without the ability to save your settings as the new default.

Here are some fun resources for how to use some of the more advanced features of Shtytlkr:

The current bot will read anything you give it via the `/say` command, up to 1000 characters.
